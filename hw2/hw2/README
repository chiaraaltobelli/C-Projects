Homework 2 - The Static Quo
September 28, 2022

This program takes a line of input entered by the user and compares each character to an element of an array of structs with different categories.
The categories include: vowels, consonants, lower, upper, digits, letter, punctuation, ascenders, descenders, curvy, and sticky.
It compares each user entered character to each character in each element in the array of structs.
The program then counts total matches for each array element. The output is each category, the characters it contains, and the total number of matches.

This program takes the following input:
User entered value from getline stored to getInput.

The following files are included:
-sq.c (main)
-charcat.c
-ChrCat.h
-GNUmakefile

The following functions are included:
sq.c: 
-static char *getstr: prompts the user to enter input, gets the input and the length of the input

charcat.c:
void testCategories: This is the only function available from the main (sq.c). This function creates an array to hold total category counts and calls the other functions to 
get length of array elements, check for matches, and convert the output to string.
static void categoryLength: Gets the length of each element in the array.
static void totalMatch: Checks to see if the user input character matches the character from the array element and counts the matches.
static char *chrcatToString: For each element in the array of structs, converts to string so the output can be printed.

The following information is output:
Category name and characters it contains
Totals for each category
